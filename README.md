# Catminator

This project aims to create a cat detector software based on a Raspberry Pi and an infrared camera. The detector might
consist in two parts, a motion detector and a cat detector. The purpose of the motion detector is only to detect a
motion in the camera range, the software should be simple and power efficient, it will only be used to trigger the
actual cat detection. The cat detection will be done using machine learning, the model should be trained with black and
white images and simply says "cat" or "no cat" as an output.
